// from dj2 apache creates user grants sudo digoc linode YES apache sqlite NO nginx superagent

hostnamectl set-hostname <what-ever>
nano ect/hosts

some tutorials create an user as soon as they ssh to the server, but they are somehow connected as root. in ec2 is kinda different since it connects as ubuntu user, this is kind of confusing, should i create a new user (which they recommend for when connecting through root) and grant sudo group priviledges? or would this be overkill? 
someone answered in fb: ubuntuu should be fine. I don't usually deploy to AWS, so I'm used to coming in as root, making a new user and doing my own server hardening

adduser  <whatevername> 
adduser <whatevername> sudo
