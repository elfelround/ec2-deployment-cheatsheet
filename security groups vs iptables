first huge diference with ec2 is it uses what they call security groups as a firewall, when you set an ec2 you easily see it on the init wizard step 6

query? do i need to open 8000 on secure groups? or just on ufw? I can test this by running runserver with nginx first with only 80
open on securegroups and 8000 open on ufw and then with 8000 open on both
