What is systemd and why does it matter to Linux users?

standard process for controlling what programs run when a Linux system boots up. While systemd is compatible with SysV and Linux Standard Base (LSB) init scripts, systemd is meant to be a drop-in replacement for these older ways of getting a Linux system running.

Systemd, which was created by Red Hat's Lennart Poettering and Kay Sievers, does more than start the core programs running. It also starts a journal of system activity, the network stack, a cron-style job scheduler, user logins, and many other jobs. That may sound good to you, but some developers hate it
