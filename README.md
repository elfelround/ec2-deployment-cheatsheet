not using root, establishing an user and granting it priviledges
for development with python, do you think it is recommended to create a new user and grant it sudo privileges to start with?

what security groups should we really need to open?

pipenv/virtualenv/docker

supervisor
gunicorn  make sure it has logs
nginx
